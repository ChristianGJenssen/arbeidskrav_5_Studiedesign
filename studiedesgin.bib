This review contrasts maximal and submaximal exercise testing. Two major categories of submaximal tests (ie, predictive and performance tests) and their relative merits are described. Predictive tests are submaximal tests that are used to predict maximal aerobic capacity. Performance tests involve measuring the responses to standardized physical activities that are typically encountered in everyday life. To maximize the validity and reliability of data obtained from submaximal tests, physical therapists are cautioned to apply the tests selectively based on their indications; to adhere to methods, including the requisite number of practice sessions; and to use measurements such as heart rate, blood pressure, exertion, and pain to evaluate test performance and to safely monitor patients.},

	abstract = {In most legal orders, human germline modification is either prohibited or severely restricted. A recurring thought in these legal frameworks is that heritable genome editing would result in practices that are at odds with principles of human rights, such as dignity, justice, and equality. However, now that CRISPR is bringing heritable genome editing within human reach, the question has risen as to whether these human rights bans still make sense. The call is growing louder to lift the ban on heritable genome editing for therapeutic purposes as soon as the technology is safe for introduction in the clinic. This article critically examines these recent proposals from a human rights perspective. First, it examines the question as to how realistic the proposed distinction between the therapeutic and the nontherapeutic uses of human germline modification is in the CRISPR era. Second, it argues that these proposals rely on a one-dimensional understanding of the meaning of human rights for this issue. Finally, it suggests that this one-dimensional understanding paves the way for a regime of self-regulation by the scientific community that leaves little room for public debate on the question as to whether or how human germline modification fits in the long-term aspirations of society.},

Some may think that Newton’s cautionary note, which was in keeping with an experimental approach espoused by Francis Bacon, is inapplicable to current experimental method since, in accord with the philosopher Karl Popper, modern-day hypotheses are framed to serve as instruments of falsification, as opposed to verification. But Popper’s “critical rationalist” framework too is problematic. It has been accused of being: inconsistent on philosophical grounds; unworkable for modern “large science,” such as systems biology; inconsistent with the actual goals of experimental science, which is verification and not falsification; and harmful to the process of discovery as a practical matter. A criticism of the hypothesis as a framework for experimentation is offered. Presented is an alternative framework—the query/model approach—which many scientists may discover is the framework they are actually using, despite being required to give lip service to the hypothesis.},

Participants (N = 400; men = 250 and women = 150), ages 18 to 40 years, successfully completed a maximal graded exercise test (GXT) at 1 of 3 laboratories to determine VO2max. The TMJ test was completed during the first 2 stages of the GXT. Following 3 min of walking (Stage 1), participants achieved a steady-state heart rate (HR) while exercising at a comfortable self-selected submaximal jogging speed at level grade (Stage 2). Gender, age, body mass, steady-state HR, and jogging speed (mph) were included as independent variables in the following multiple linear regression model to predict VO2max (R = 0.91, standard error of estimate [SEE] = 2.52 mL · kg−1 · min−1): VO2max (mL · kg−1 · min−1) = 58.687 + (7.520 × Gender; 0 = woman and 1 = man) + (4.334 × mph) − (0.211 × kg) − (0.148 × HR) − (0.107 × Age). Based on the predicted residual sum of squares (PRESS) statistics (RPRESS = 0.91, SEE PRESS = 2.54 mL · kg−1 · min−1) and small total error (TE; 2.50 mL · kg−1 · min−1; 5.3\% of VO2max) and constant error (CE; −0.008 mL · kg−1 · min−1) terms, this new prediction equation displays minimal shrinkage. It should also demonstrate similar accuracy when it is applied to other samples that include participants of comparable age, body mass, and aerobic fitness level. This simple TMJ test and its corresponding regression model provides a relatively safe, convenient, and accurate way to predict VO2max in fit adults, ages 18 to 40 years.},

	abstract = {Reliability refers to the reproducibility of values of a test, assay or other measurement in repeated trials on the same individuals. Better reliability implies better precision of single measurements and better tracking of changes in measurements in research or practical settings. The main measures of reliability are within-subject random variation, systematic change in the mean, and retest correlation. A simple, adaptable form of within-subject variation is the typical (standard) error of measurement: the standard deviation of an individual's repeated measurements. For many measurements in sports medicine and science, the typical error is best expressed as a coefficient of variation (percentage of the mean). A biased, more limited form of within-subject variation is the limits of agreement: the 95\% likely range of change of an individual's measurements between 2 trials. Systematic changes in the mean of a measure between consecutive trials represent such effects as learning, motivation or fatigue; these changes need to be eliminated from estimates of within-subject variation. Retest correlation is difficult to interpret, mainly because its value is sensitive to the heterogeneity of the sample of participants. Uses of reliability include decision-making when monitoring individuals, comparison of tests or equipment, estimation of sample size in experiments and estimation of the magnitude of individual differences in the response to a treatment. Reasonable precision for estimates of reliability requires approximately 50 study participants and at least 3 trials. Studies aimed at assessing variation in reliability between tests or equipment require complex designs and analyses that researchers seldom perform correctly. A wider understanding of reliability and adoption of the typical error as the standard measure of reliability would improve the assessment of tests and equipment in our disciplines.},

	doi = {10.1123/ijspp.5.4.546},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: This investigation aimed to quantify the typical variation for kinetic and kinematic variables measured during loaded jump squats.
METHODS: Thirteen professional athletes performed six maximal effort countermovement jumps on four occasions. Testing occurred over 2 d, twice per day (8 AM and 2 PM) separated by 7 d, with the same procedures replicated on each occasion. Jump height, peak power (PP), relative peak power (RPP), mean power (MP), peak velocity (PV), peak force (PF), mean force (MF), and peak rate of force development (RFD) measurements were obtained from a linear optical encoder attached to a 40 kg barbell.
RESULTS: A diurnal variation in performance was observed with afternoon values displaying an average increase of 1.5-5.6\% for PP, RPP, MP, PV, PF, and MF when compared with morning values (effect sizes ranging from 0.2-0.5). Day to day reliability was estimated by comparing the morning trials (AM reliability) and the afternoon trials (PM reliability). In both AM and PM conditions, all variables except RFD demonstrated coefficients of variations ranging between 0.8-6.2\%. However, for a number of variables (RPP, MP, PV and height), AM reliability was substantially better than PM. PF and MF were the only variables to exhibit a coefficient of variation less than the smallest worthwhile change in both conditions.
DISCUSSION: Results suggest that power output and associated variables exhibit a diurnal rhythm, with improved performance in the afternoon. Morning testing may be preferable when practitioners are seeking to conduct regular monitoring of an athlete's performance due to smaller variability.},

Twenty-five men performed squat, countermovement, and drop jumps with the linear transducer connected from a waist belt and base, which were placed upon a force platform. The Pearson correlation coefficients across the 3 jumps for the mean force (r = 0.952-0.962), peak force (r = 0.861-0.934), and time-to-peak force (r = 0.924-0.995) were high, providing evidence that the linear-transducer and force-platform measurements were similar. The trial-to-trial reliability of the jumps measured by the linear position transducer gave an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.924-0.975 for mean force, 0.977-0.982 for peak force, and 0.721-0.964 for time-to-peak force. The coefficients of variation were 2.1-4.5\% for mean force, 2.5-8.4\% for peak force, and 4.1-11.8\% for time-to-peak force. Our findings showed that the calculations derived from the linear transducer were very similar to those of the force platform and hence provided evidence of the validity of this method. The data from the linear transducer were also shown to be reliable. Therefore, this method of calculating force may provide a cost-effective alternative to the force platform for measuring this variable.},

          Purpose 
          It has been suggested that endurance training influences the running economy (CR) and the oxygen uptake (V̇O2) kinetics in heavy exercise by accelerating the primary phase and attenuating the V̇O2 slow component. However, the effects of heavy weight training (HWT) in combination with endurance training remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of a concurrent HWT+endurance training on CR and the V̇O2 kinetics in endurance athletes.
          Methods 
          Fifteen triathletes were assigned to endurance+strength (ES) or endurance-only (E) training for 14 wk. The training program was similar, except ES performed two HWT sessions a week. Before and after the training period, the subjects performed 1) an incremental field running test for determination of V̇O2max and the velocity associated (VV̇O2max), the second ventilatory threshold (VT2); 2) a 3000-m run at constant velocity, calculated to require 25\% of the difference between V̇O2max and VT2, to determine CR and the characteristics of the V̇O2 kinetics; 3) maximal hopping tests to determine maximal mechanical power and lower-limb stiffness; 4) maximal concentric lower-limb strength measurements.
          Results 
          After the training period, maximal strength were increased (P {\textless} 0.01) in ES but remained unchanged in E. Hopping power decreased in E (P {\textless} 0.05). After training, economy (P {\textless} 0.05) and hopping power (P {\textless} 0.001) were greater in ES than in E. V̇O2max, leg hopping stiffness and the V̇O2 kinetics were not significantly affected by training either in ES or E.
          Conclusion 
          Additional HWT led to improved maximal strength and running economy with no significant effects on the V̇O2 kinetics pattern in heavy exercise.},

Running economy (RE) was assessed during 3 × 4 minute treadmill runs (14, 16, and 18 km·h−1), followed by an incremental test to measure O2max. Muscle power characteristics were assessed on a portable, unidirectional ground reaction force plate. Compared with CON, PLY improved RE at 18 km·h−1 (4.1\%, p = 0.02), but not at 14 or 16 km·h−1. This was accompanied by trends for increased average power during a 5-jump plyometric test (15\%, p = 0.11), a shorter time to reach maximal dynamic strength during a strength quality assessment test (14\%, p = 0.09), and a lower O2-speed slope (14\%, p = 0.12) after 9 weeks of PLY. There were no significant differences in cardiorespiratory measures or O2max as a result of PLY. In a group of highly-trained distance runners, 9 weeks of PLY improved RE, with likely mechanisms residing in the muscle, or alternatively by improving running mechanics.},

          Methods: 
          Seventeen well-trained (nine male and eight female) runners were randomly assigned into either an intervention or a control group. The intervention group (four males and four females) performed half-squats, four sets of four repetitions maximum, three times per week for 8 wk, as a supplement to their normal endurance training. The control group continued their normal endurance training during the same period.
          Results: 
          The intervention manifested significant improvements in 1RM (33.2\%), RFD (26.0\%), RE (5.0\%), and time to exhaustion at MAS (21.3\%). No changes were found in V˙O2max or body weight. The control group exhibited no changes from pre to post values in any of the parameters.

	abstract = {This study determined whether a 6-week regimen of plyometric training would improve running economy (i.e., the oxygen cost of submaximal running). Eighteen regular but not highly trained distance runners (age = 29 ± 7 [mean ± SD] years) were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. All subjects continued regular running training for 6 weeks; experimental subjects also did plyometric training. Dependent variables measured before and after the 6-week period were economy of running on a level treadmill at 3 velocities (women: 2.23, 2.68, and 3.13 m-s1; men: 2.68, 3.13, and 3.58 m-s1), Vo2max, and indirect indicators of ability of muscles of lower limbs to store and return elastic energy. The last were measurements during jumping tests on an inclined (20°) sled: maximal jump height with and without countermovement and efficiencies of series of 40 sub-maximal countermovement and static jumps. The plyometric training improved economy (p {\textless} 0.05). Averaged values (m-ml-kg“1) for the 3 running speeds were: (a) experimental subjects—5.14 ± 0.39 pretraining, 5.26 ± 0.39 posttrain-ing; and (b) control subjects—5.10 ± 0.36 pretraining, 5.06 ± 0.36 posttraining. The Vo2max did not change with training. Plyometric training did not result in changes in jump height or efficiency variables that would have indicated improved ability to store and return elastic energy. We conclude that 6 weeks of plyometric training improves running economy in regular but not highly trained distance runners; the mechanism must still be determined.},

	abstract = {Key points For individuals showing suboptimal adaptations to resistance training, manipulation of training volume is a potential measure to facilitate responses. This remains unexplored. Here, 34 untrained individuals performed contralateral resistance training with moderate and low volume for 12 weeks. Moderate volume led to larger increases in muscle cross-sectional area, strength and type II fibre-type transitions. These changes coincided with greater activation of signalling pathways controlling muscle growth and greater induction of ribosome synthesis. Out of 34 participants, thirteen displayed clear benefit of MOD on muscle hypertrophy and sixteen showed clear benefit of MOD on muscle strength gains. This coincided with greater total RNA accumulation in the early phase of the training period, suggesting that ribosomal biogenesis regulates the dose–response relationship between training volume and muscle hypertrophy. These results demonstrate that there is a dose-dependent relationship between training volume and outcomes. On the individual level, benefits of higher training volume were associated with increased ribosomal biogenesis. Abstract Resistance-exercise volume is a determinant of training outcomes. However not all individuals respond in a dose-dependent fashion. In this study, 34 healthy individuals (males n = 16, 23.6 (4.1) years; females n = 18, 22.0 (1.3) years) performed moderate- (3 sets per exercise, MOD) and low-volume (1 set, LOW) resistance training in a contralateral fashion for 12 weeks (2–3 sessions per week). Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and strength were assessed at Weeks 0 and 12, along with biopsy sampling (m. vastus lateralis). Muscle biopsies were also sampled before and 1 h after the fifth session (Week 2). MOD resulted in larger increases in muscle CSA (5.2 (3.8)\% versus 3.7 (3.7)\%, P {\textless} 0.001) and strength (3.4–7.7\% difference, all P {\textless} 0.05. This coincided with greater reductions in type IIX fibres from Week 0 to Week 12 (MOD, −4.6 percentage points; LOW −3.2 percentage points), greater phosphorylation of S6-kinase 1 (p85 S6K1Thr412, 19\%; p70 S6K1Thr389, 58\%) and ribosomal protein S6Ser235/236 (37\%), greater rested-state total RNA (8.8\%) and greater exercise-induced c-Myc mRNA expression (25\%; Week 2, all P {\textless} 0.05). Thirteen and sixteen participants, respectively, displayed clear benefits in response to MOD on muscle hypertrophy and strength. Benefits were associated with greater accumulation of total RNA at Week 2 in the MOD leg, with every 1\% difference increasing the odds of MOD benefit by 7.0\% (P = 0.005) and 9.8\% (P = 0.002). In conclusion, MOD led to greater functional and biological adaptations than LOW. Associations between dose-dependent total RNA accumulation and increases in muscle mass and strength point to ribosome biogenesis as a determinant of dose-dependent training responses.},
